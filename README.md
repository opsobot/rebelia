Rebelia - An Open Source Robotic Hand for Humans and Robots
===========================================================


Overview
========

Welcome to the Robotic Hand Project — an open-source, humanlike robotic hand designed for researchers, students, and robotics enthusiasts. Our goal is to provide an affordable, high-performance robotic hand under 2000 EUR, open to community contributions and continuous improvement.
This project is released under the CERN Open Hardware License (OHL-S), ensuring the design remains open-source and preventing patent claims on its core innovations.

Features
* Fully 3D-printable design using affordable materials.
* Commercial off-the-shelf components for servos and electronics.
* Custom firmware for precise motor control.
* Modularity for easy upgrades and customization.
